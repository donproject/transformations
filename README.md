# Transformations
A game to help geometry students with descriptive and coordinate transformations.

## How it works
Essentially, the app picks one (or two) random geometric transformations and applies them to a randomly generated polygon. It displays the pre-image and the image and then presents the user with options to recreate the transformation. If they're right, they get the same number of points as the level they have chosen. If they are incorrect, they get a second chance for half of the points. If they are wrong again, they get zero points and the app displays one possible correct answer.

The app uses HTML 5, CSS 3, Javascript and JQuery 2.1.3. It was programmed in Sublime Text 2 on a Mac laptop I bought off craigslist for real cheap. I've only tested it in Chrome. It probably looks terrible on your phone.

### Known issues
I should probably work on the code a bit. The app works, but maybe not as perfectly as possible. I have a lot to learn.
Mobile version? Meh.
It seems that in the most recent version of Chrome on Mac, the axes do not appear. That makes me sad.
The game is difficult. It's supposed to be.
